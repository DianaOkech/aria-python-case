Aria – Data Analytics Case Study

This repository contains my submission for the Aria data analytics case study.  
The analysis focuses on loan production, insurance penetration, portfolio characteristics, and loan distributions using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

The notebooks are structured to follow the analytical questions in a clear, logical order, starting with exploratory data analysis and moving into specific metric calculations.
